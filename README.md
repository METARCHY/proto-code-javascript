# proto-code-javascript

This is a general pseudo-code that should be modified and implemented to suit the specifics of JavaScript and your preferred platform. You will also need to create classes for players, actors, locations, resources, and action cards, as well as implement the logic details to handle conflicts, resources, and other aspects of the game.

Note that the pseudocode lacks detail on many of the features, as the implementation of a Metarchy game can be quite complex and require additional research and design.
